## Magical Arsenal

**Weapons of Choice** | React (like a ninja), TypeScript (with pinpoint accuracy), NodeJS (because who needs sleep), Docker (container wrangler extraordinaire)

**Trusty Sidekicks** | NoSQL (data whisperer), NextJS (because regular React is too mainstream), Vite (speed demon), Vitest (bug exterminator), Puppeteer (chrome tamer), Tailwind (CSS without tears)

**Secret Crushes** | Svelte (the cool kid), Astro (star-gazer), LangChain (AI conductor), React Native (phone enchanter), Cloudflare (shield bearer), Vercel (deployment sorcery)

## Adventures in Employment

### [Veritus](https://www.veritus.ai/) (Aug 2024 - now)

**Senior Software Development Wizard** | Making computers do impossible things while management isn't looking.

- **The Next Saga** | Performed necromancy on a dead codebase, transforming it into a TypeScript monorepo so type-safe it makes the compiler blush. Installed digital smoke detectors (Sentry) and heartbeat monitors (UptimeRobot) so we know when things catch fire. Connected money tubes (Stripe) for that sweet, sweet revenue.

  - NextJS, tRPC, Mongoose, LangChain, Tailwind, PostHog, CI/CD, Stripe

- **The Search Chronicles** | Built a bibliomancer's dream: a search engine that can find your academic paper needle in a 3TB haystack. Makes Google Scholar look like a kid with a magnifying glass.

  - OpenSearch, Cohere, Embeddings, AWS Lambda, Python, Docker, Vector Search

### [SaaS Labs](https://www.saaslabs.co/) (Jun 2022 - Aug 2024)

**Software Development Enchanter (SDEII)** | Conjuring digital experiences and occasionally making good decisions.

- **Project Apex** | Created a UI so next-gen it made the previous gen cry. JustCall has never looked so pretty.

  - React, Remix, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Vite, Vitest, Docker

- **AI Meeting Crasher** | Taught robots to join Zoom meetings, take better notes than humans, and summarize conversations without falling asleep. The first AI to perfect the "I'm totally paying attention" head nod.

  - Puppeteer, NodeJS, Docker, Kubernetes, Whisper, LangChain, FFmpeg, Distributed systems

- **Search Wizardry** | Built a search engine that could find things across multiple products. Like Google, but for just one company, so infinitely less impressive but still pretty cool.

  - React, Vite, NodeJS, Shadow DOM, Algolia, Cheerio, Docker, Jenkins, Puppeteer, OpenAI

### [StoryXpress](https://storyxpress.co/) (Jul 2020 - Sep 2020)

**Full-Stack Apprentice** | Learned the ancient art of git conflict resolution and human cooperation.

- Built an internal dashboard that made spreadsheets obsolete and a Google Drive knockoff that made actual Google Drive seem overrated.

  - React, Webpack, NodeJS, ExpressJS

---

## Freelance Heroics

### [htOS](https://htos-demo.sharath.uk/) (Apr 2022 - July 2022)

**DevOps Mercenary** | Created a hostel room management system that prevented civil wars over who gets which room. Made code so type-safe it could survive freshman orientation.

- React, NextJS, Blitz.js, PostgreSQL, NextAuth, Prisma

### [covid19tracker.in (defunct)](https://c19-react.pages.dev/) (Sep 2021 - Dec 2021)

**Lead Digital Pandemic Fighter** | Led a team tracking invisible enemies. Scaled to 3 TB of traffic, mostly people checking if they could go outside yet.

- NodeJS, CDN, Cloudflare, GitHub Actions, Docker, PostgreSQL

### [Office of Career Services](https://ocs.iith.ac.in/) (Feb 2020 - Apr 2021)

**Web Development Savior** | Created the digital matchmaker between desperate students and choosy recruiters. Built from nothing, like the universe, but with more JavaScript errors.

- React, JavaScript, MaterialUI, NodeJS, Express, MySQL

---

## Side Quest Projects

- **[sca.run](https://www.sca.run)** | My blog where I pretend to know things.

  - Astro, Remark, TypeScript

  - Docker Swarm, Cloudflare Tunnel, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, GlusterFS, SOPS, Linux

<details>
  <summary>Desktop apps, games, clusters, libraries, AI and more [click for the extended universe]</summary>

- **[maaybe](https://github.com/tnfssc/maaybe)** | A library that introduces uncertainty to TypeScript because programming wasn't anxiety-inducing enough.

  - TypeScript, GitHub Actions, NPM, Jest

## The Academic Chapter

### [Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/) (2018 - 2022)

**Bachelor of Technology in Engineering Science** | Learned how computers think, networks talk, and operating systems argue. Also built drones that barely flew, logic circuits that occasionally worked, and IoT devices that mostly spied on me.
